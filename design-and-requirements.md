## Flexible Canvas-Based Workflow Tool: Initial Design Draft

### Overview
The tool is designed to allow creators to develop and refine stories, scripts, and storyboards in a non-sequential, dynamic workflow. The central "canvas" connects all components (idea, script, plot, storyboard, and more) in an integrated, visual manner. Changes in one component dynamically update others, ensuring a holistic and flexible approach to storytelling.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Central Canvas**
- A visual workspace where users can see all interconnected components (idea, script, plot, storyboard) at a glance.
- Supports drag-and-drop functionality to rearrange components visually.
- Zoom in/out on specific components for detailed or high-level views.

#### 2. **Components and Interconnections**
Each component of the workflow is represented as a node on the canvas, connected to others. These include:

- **Idea Node**: Contains rough ideas, themes, or inspirations.
  - AI-assisted generation of themes or brainstorming prompts.

- **Plot Node**: A sequence of events or key story beats.
  - Editable timeline to rearrange scenes.
  - Visual indicators showing connections to the script and storyboard.

- **Script Node**: Text-based screenplay with dynamic links to plot and characters.
  - Updates automatically when plot or character details change.
  - Allows manual editing with real-time feedback on connected components.

- **Character Node**: Profiles of key characters with traits, backstory, and motivations.
  - AI-assisted suggestions for dialogue consistency and character development.

- **Storyboard Node**: Visual representation of scenes.
  - Integrates images or sketches (AI-generated or user-uploaded).
  - Allows rearranging or replacing scenes, triggering updates in connected components.

#### 3. **Dynamic Synchronization**
- Changes in any node automatically propagate to connected nodes:
  - Rearranging plot updates the script.
  - Editing a characterâ€™s traits adjusts their dialogue in the script.
  - Modifying a storyboard updates corresponding script and plot points.

#### 4. **Non-Sequential Workflow**
- Users can start at any step and move freely between steps:
  - Begin with a storyboard, then backtrack to plot and script.
  - Develop characters first, then generate plot and storyboard.
- Allows iterative refinement rather than a fixed linear process.

#### 5. **AI Integration**
- **Idea Generation**: Brainstorm themes, plot points, or dialogue.
- **Plot Drafting**: Automatically suggest plot sequences based on characters and themes.
- **Script Assistance**: Generate scripts or refine user-provided drafts.
- **Storyboard Visualization**: AI-generated visual storyboards based on the script or plot.

#### 6. **User Interface Features**
- **Modular Nodes**: Each component (idea, plot, script, etc.) can be collapsed, expanded, or rearranged.
- **History Tracking**: Undo/redo changes across all components.
- **Version Control**: Save multiple iterations of the project and compare changes.
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing with comments and suggestions.

### Workflow Example
1. **Start with an Idea**:
   - Use the Idea Node to jot down a theme (e.g., "A heist in a futuristic city").
   - AI generates a rough plot outline.

2. **Develop Characters**:
   - Create profiles for main characters.
   - AI suggests motivations and relationships.

3. **Draft the Plot**:
   - Arrange key events on the Plot Node.
   - Rearrange scenes visually on the canvas.

4. **Generate a Script**:
   - Script Node populates dialogue and action lines based on the plot.
   - User edits dialogue to refine tone and pacing.

5. **Visualize with Storyboards**:
   - AI generates sketches for each scene.
   - User uploads custom artwork or adjusts scene descriptions.

6. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Modify plot order based on storyboard feedback.
   - Adjust character traits and motivations, propagating changes to script and plot.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Frontend**:
   - Canvas-based UI (e.g., using a library like React Flow or Cytoscape).
   - Modular components for nodes with drag-and-drop functionality.

2. **Backend**:
   - Graph database to manage node interconnections (e.g., Neo4j).
   - APIs for AI services (text generation, image generation).

3. **AI Models**:
   - Text-based models for script and dialogue generation (e.g., GPT-based).
   - Visual models for storyboard creation (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

### Next Steps
1. **Wireframe Design**:
   - Create mockups for the canvas and individual nodes.

2. **Prototype Development**:
   - Build a basic interactive canvas with dynamic node linking.

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Test initial AI features for plot, script, and storyboard generation.

4. **User Testing**:
   - Gather feedback from storytellers and filmmakers to refine the tool.
