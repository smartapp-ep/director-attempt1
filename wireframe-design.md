**Wireframes, Technical Requirements, Sample Workflows, and Feedback Plan for the Flexible Film Canvas**

### 1. Develop Wireframes

#### 1.1 Canvas Overview Wireframe
- **Central Hub:** Displays nodes connected by labeled pathways indicating their relationships (e.g., Plot -> Script -> Storyboard).
- **Interactive Nodes:** Clickable elements for "Idea," "Plot," "Script," etc., each with hover descriptions.
- **Navigation Panel:** Sidebar or top menu allowing quick access to all nodes or global settings.
- **Dynamic Updates Indicator:** Visual cues (e.g., color changes or icons) to show which components are dynamically updated after a change.
- **Search/Filter Functionality:** A top bar for filtering scenes, characters, or other elements.

#### 1.2 Individual Node Interfaces

**1.2.1 Plot Node Wireframe:**
- **Timeline View:** A horizontal timeline with draggable scene markers.
- **Scene Details Panel:** Opens on marker click, showing scene name, description, and relationships (e.g., linked script, storyboard).
- **Add/Remove Scene Buttons:** Quick tools to modify the plot structure.

**1.2.2 Script Node Wireframe:**
- **Text Editor:** Central area for script writing with sections for action lines, dialogues, and descriptions.
- **Sidebar:** Links to related nodes (e.g., characters, scenes).
- **Real-Time Updates:** Highlight areas auto-modified based on changes in linked nodes.

**1.2.3 Storyboard Node Wireframe:**
- **Scene Thumbnails:** Scrollable gallery of sketches or images.
- **Detail Panel:** Opens upon selecting a thumbnail, showing linked settings, props, and character visuals.

**1.2.4 Settings and Props Nodes:**
- **Catalog View:** Grid or list format for easy navigation of existing entries.
- **Detail Editor:** Panels to edit or add specific settings/props.
- **Link Management:** Tools to associate settings/props with scenes or characters.

### 2. Define Technical Requirements

#### 2.1 Dynamic Synchronization
- **Database Design:**
  - Centralized schema with interconnected tables for nodes (e.g., Plot, Script, Storyboard).
  - Example: Scene table links to Plot, Script, Settings, and Props tables.

- **Event-Driven Updates:**
  - Implement real-time event propagation using frameworks like WebSocket or Firebase.
  - Example: A "Scene Updated" event triggers updates in all linked components.

#### 2.2 Scalability and Performance Optimization
- **Caching:**
  - Use caching to reduce the load on the database for frequently accessed data.
  - Example: Cache storyboard thumbnails to speed up node transitions.

- **Incremental Updates:**
  - Only refresh modified elements instead of reloading the entire canvas.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Define fail-safes to maintain data integrity during synchronization.

#### 2.3 Integration APIs
- Enable exporting/importing to tools like Final Draft, Celtx, or Trello.
- Allow third-party plugin development to extend functionality.

### 3. Create Sample Workflows

#### 3.1 Workflow 1: Adding a New Scene
1. Open "Plot Node."
2. Drag a new marker into the timeline.
3. Add details (e.g., name, brief description).
4. Automatically:
   - A script template appears in the "Script Node."
   - A blank storyboard thumbnail is generated.
   - A new entry is created in "Settings Node" with placeholders.

#### 3.2 Workflow 2: Modifying a Character Trait
1. Open "Character Node" and update a trait (e.g., "Brave" to "Cautious").
2. Automatically:
   - Linked dialogues in "Script Node" adjust for tone and language.
   - Visual representation updates in "Storyboard Node."
   - Impacted scenes are flagged for user review in "Plot Node."

#### 3.3 Workflow 3: Updating a Setting
1. Open "Settings Node" and modify details (e.g., "Modern Apartment" to "Rustic Cabin").
2. Automatically:
   - Linked storyboard visuals reflect new style notes.
   - Props in "Props Node" update to match the setting.

### 4. Gather User Feedback

#### 4.1 Key Use Cases for Feedback
1. Creating a project from scratch.
2. Revising an existing script or storyboard.
3. Synchronizing multiple changes across nodes.
4. Exporting/importing workflows to external tools.

#### 4.2 Feedback Collection Methods
- **Surveys:** Structured questionnaires focusing on usability, intuitiveness, and feature gaps.
- **Prototype Testing:** Early-stage testing with a small group of users (e.g., screenwriters, directors).
- **Focus Groups:** Sessions discussing specific workflows and challenges faced.
- **Analytics:** Track in-app behavior to identify bottlenecks or underused features.

#### 4.3 Feedback Implementation
- **Prioritize High-Impact Changes:** Address user pain points that significantly improve workflow efficiency.
- **Iterative Updates:** Release incremental updates, validating each change with further feedback.
- **Transparent Communication:** Share release notes and future plans with users to maintain engagement.

### Summary and Next Steps
- The wireframes outline user interfaces and their interactive components.
- Technical requirements focus on scalability, real-time synchronization, and seamless integration.
- Sample workflows validate the systemâ€™s non-sequential editing capabilities.
- User feedback will shape refinements and ensure alignment with real-world needs.

Next Steps:
- Develop low-fidelity prototypes based on wireframes.
- Implement the first set of features for a minimum viable product (MVP).
- Conduct initial user testing to iterate on functionality and design.
